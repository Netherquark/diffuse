Hello there! I see you want to build Diffuse.
<p> The process can seem quite complicated, especially if you aren't familiar with concepts like Nix, just like I wasn't when I started out. Don't worry,this guide is here to help you. </p>
<p> First off, determine your operating system (of choice). The setup process is considerably easier on MacOS and Linux, but it is still theoretically possible on Windows. </p>

**Prerequisites for MacOS and Linux**  
1. Curl
2. Basic CLI operation knowledge

**Linux guide** [Tested on Ubuntu 20.10]
1. Set up Git. (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/)
2. Clone Diffuse with `git clone https://www.github.com/icidasset/diffuse`
3. Install Nix using `curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh`
4. Reboot (recommended)
5. Navigate to the Diffuse folder using `cd`
6. Execute `nix-shell`
7. Execute `just install-deps` after the previous step finishes
8. Execute `just`.
9. ???
